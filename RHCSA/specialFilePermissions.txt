	Let's learn about special file permissions and how to handle default file permissions 
	
	Special Permissions : 
		Constitues a fourth permission!!
	1.) suid -> u+s : The file is executed as the user who created the file , not the user who ran the file , OnDir -> No effect 
	2.) sgid -> g+s : The file is executed as the group who created the file , not the user who ran the file, On Dir -> Files newly created in that dir , are set to be owned by the owner who created that directory
	2.) sticky -> o+t : No effect on user , OnDir -> User's with write access to that directory can only remove files that they own in that directory not the files that other users own!!!!
	

	Numerically Fourth Preceding digit -> setuid = 4 , setgid = 2 , sticky = 1;

	To set the gid  with rwx for user and group but no access for other's 

	chmod 2770 directory
	
	The default dir permission is 0777 for directories assigned by the operating systems , For files it is 0666 rw-rw-rw !
	
	Umask is used to define the default permission set by the operating system when a user login's , ex 022 means the write bit is cleared for the groups and other user's 	, 
	a umask of 077 clears the rwx for group and other's 
	
	use umask command to get the value of current session umask.
